When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	In case of failure; your hardware may fail and it would be better if a copy of your data was kept somewhere safe online so you can retrieve it and continue your work after the failure has been resolved

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because the project at hand may be a collaboration between many people, a new file (or commit) might be added by one of the collaborators to the remote repository, this file, if git automatically pulls changes from the remote repository, may cause a problem with the version of the local project I'm currently working on.

	It's better to always pull changes manually as in such case you are handpicking the commits you are about to pull before doing so.
